  <h1>Mart, Cloth simulation E-commerce Store</h1>

  <p>
is a cutting-edge e-commerce store for clothing enthusiasts. It is built with Next.js and utilizes the advanced cloth simulation capabilities of Three.js and Blender, powered by the Physi.js library.
With this project, users can shop for the latest styles and trends in clothing, while also experiencing the realism and interactivity of cloth simulation. The store features a wide range of products, including tops, bottoms, dresses, and accessories, all modeled with stunning detail and accuracy.
The use of Three.js and Blender ensures that the clothing items look and behave as realistically as possible, with accurate draping and movement. The Physi.js library adds further depth to the simulation, allowing for realistic physics-based interactions between the clothing items and the user.  </p>
